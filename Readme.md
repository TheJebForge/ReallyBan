# Really Ban?

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that modifies "Ban from hosted sessions" and "Ban from current session" buttons to require double taps to actually ban

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [ReallyBan.dll](https://github.com/TheJebForge/ReallyBan/releases/latest/download/ReallyBan.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
